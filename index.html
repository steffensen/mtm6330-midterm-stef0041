          <h2>Marketing</h2>
          <p class="hide">Traditional outbound marketing like television, radio, direct mail, and the
            newspaper are the most commonly known strategies, but not everyone that receives these messages are
            looking
            for what
            you offer, plus a growing number of people are finding the same information but from a more convenient
            form, online and mobile!</p>
          <p>With the ability to target your ideal customers through Facebook, you won't have
            to reach people that aren't interested or qualified to do business with you. Now an important part when
            communicating with your audience, is to meet your audience where they are at in the process. They could
            just be anywhere from your business awareness, interest, consideration, intent, evaluation, or
            purchasing.
            Statistics show that by the year 2020, online video will make up more than 80% of all consumer internet
            traffic. </p>

            <h2>Jordan Coghill</h2>
            <p class="hideMe">Born and raised in Regina Saskatchewan, Jordan grew up with a hunger to entertain. From
              television
              and film
              sets to
              editing booths, and theatre stages, he would always be willing to learn new skills either in front or
              behind
              the
              camera. When it came to Social Media, Jordan was able to create video content to advertise on Facebook
              and
              Instagram
              while thoroughly enjoying the feedback he would receive for his work. In the last year, there has been
              a vast
              rate of
              evolved ways of thought and new knowledge that always has Jordan asking himself “Does this entertain to
              retain?” and
              “Am I providing enough value?” type of questions. Having said that, a new love for building Virtual
              Assistants for
              Facebook Business Pages had become a great addition to his mission to put more hours in a businesses
              day so
              that they
              can concentrate on what they do best in their industry!</p>
